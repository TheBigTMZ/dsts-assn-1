# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that explore Zomato restaurant data. The notebooks cover data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of predictive models to analyze and predict restaurant ratings.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform data analysis and predictive modeling on a Zomato restaurant dataset. The project is divided into two parts:

    Assignment 1 Part A: Focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis of the dataset.
    Assignment 1 Part B: Involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.

Features

    Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into key features of the dataset
    Application of machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests
    Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
